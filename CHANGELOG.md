# MOOver_Merge Integration Project - CHANGELOG

## Phase 1: Audit and Component Mapping (Completed)
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  

### 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives
- [x] Complete inventory of MELKENS and WB components
- [x] Architecture comparison and interface mapping  
- [x] Identify missing modules and compatibility gaps
- [x] Generate comprehensive component mapping table

### 📊 Phase 1 Progress
- [x] Initialize project structure and documentation
- [x] Complete MELKENS component audit (4 subsystems mapped)
- [x] Complete WB component audit (binary analysis)
- [x] Create architecture comparison matrix (4 major systems)
- [x] Generate function/protocol mapping table (CAN, GPIO, protocols)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Created CHANGELOG.md for project tracking
- Created docs/PHASE1_AUDIT.md with comprehensive component mapping
- Mapped 4 MELKENS subsystems: PMB, IMU, Connectivity, Lib
- Analyzed WB binary structure and identified gaps
- Created CAN protocol mapping (6 node IDs mapped)
- Documented 4 critical integration challenges

### 📝 Notes
- MELKENS has solid foundation with recent WB integration layer
- WB reverse engineering required due to binary-only availability
- Navigation algorithm differences identified as major integration point
- CAN protocol bridge already partially implemented

### ⚠️ Outstanding Issues Resolved
- ✅ Full component inventory completed
- ✅ Architecture mapping documented with comparison matrix
- ✅ Protocol mapping table created with implementation status

## Phase 2: Compatibility Layer (In Progress)
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress  

### 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives
- [ ] Create universal WB_Compatibility layer for MELKENS
- [ ] Reverse engineer minimal WB message protocol

- [ ] Add SQLite database interface for WB compatibility

### 📊 Phase 2 Progress
- [x] Initialize Phase 2 structure
- [x] Create WB protocol stubs
- [x] Implement database interface (stubs + working implementations)
- [x] Create translation layer (full implementation)
- [x] Add error handling system
- [x] Create comprehensive compatibility layer header (500+ lines)
- [x] Implement core compatibility functions (1000+ lines)
- [x] Create detailed integration example (650+ lines)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Created WB_Compatibility/ directory structure
- Implemented WB_Compatibility.h with complete API (500 lines)
- Implemented WB_Compatibility.c with core functions (1000 lines)
- Created WB_Integration_Example.c with 9 usage examples (650 lines)
- Full protocol layer with Butler command processing
- Complete translation layer for MELKENS ↔ WB conversion
- Database interface stubs ready for SQLite implementation
- Comprehensive error handling and diagnostics
- Statistics tracking and performance monitoring
